# Imperative_HOL_Time
Verifying asymptotic time complexity of imperative programs in Isabelle/HOL.

Paper at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01336

The paper corresponds to the initial commit 8d336cd, which uses the version
of auto2 (https://github.com/bzhan/auto2) at commit 167808b and Isabelle2017.

The current commit corresponds to commit 16d8325 in auto2 and Isabelle2018.

### Abstract:

We present a framework in Isabelle for verifying asymptotic time
complexity of imperative programs. We build upon an extension of
Imperative HOL and its separation logic to include running
time. In addition to the basic arguments, our framework is able
to handle advanced techniques for time complexity analysis, such
as the use of the Akra-Bazzi theorem and amortized
analysis. Various automation is built and incorporated into the
auto2 prover to reason about separation logic with time credits,
and to derive asymptotic behavior of functions. As case studies,
we verify the asymptotic time complexity (in addition to
functional correctness) of imperative algorithms and data
structures such as median of medians selection, Karatsuba's
algorithm, and splay trees.
